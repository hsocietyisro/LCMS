# LANDSCAPE CHANGE MONITORING SYSTEM (LCMS)

Landscape Chnage Monitoring System is a approach towards simplifying the process of viewing the changes in the Indian Landscape in the last few years.
The data is collected from Bhuvan Maps, a system developed by Indain Space and Reserach Organization (ISRO).
In this project we have tried to show those landscape changes in a easy way. Users can easlily switch to different years and see what changed in a timeline fashion.
